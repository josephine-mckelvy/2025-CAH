## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document that generates both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

```{r}
#Load Data set A.csv:
Data_set_A <- read_csv("Data set A.csv")
#Remove rows with NA in all columns:
clean_A <- Data_set_A %>% na.omit()

#Load Data set B.csv:
Data_set_B <- read_csv("Data set B.csv")
#Remove rows with NA in all columns:
clean_B <- Data_set_B %>% na.omit()
```
```{r}
#chr is a categorical variable with characters
#dbl is a continuous variable with a decimal value for "double precision"

#Return frequencies/counts of each categorical response option:
table(clean_A$condition, clean_A$income_level)
table(clean_B$increased_contribution)
levels(as.factor(clean_A$condition))

#Merge data frames by ID variable
contiguous <- merge(clean_A,clean_B,by="identifier")
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
